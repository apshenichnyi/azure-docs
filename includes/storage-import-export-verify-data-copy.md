Track the job to completion. Then make sure that your data has been uploaded to Azure successfully. Use the *verbose log* to verify each successfully transferred file and the *copy log* to find the source of each failed data copy. For more information, see [Review copy logs from imports and exports](..\articles\import-export\storage-import-export-tool-reviewing-job-status-v1.md).

After you verify the data transfers, you can delete your on-premises data. Delete your on-premises data only after you verify that the upload was successful.
