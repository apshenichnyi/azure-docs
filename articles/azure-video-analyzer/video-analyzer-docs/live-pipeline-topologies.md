# List of pipeline topologies

The tables that follow list the [live pipeline topologies](terminology.md#pipeline-topology) supported by Azure Video Analyzer. The tables also provide 

* A short description,
* Topology's corresponding sample tutorial(s), and 
* The corresponding pipeline topology name of the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) [Video Analyzer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azure-video-analyzer). 

Clicking on a topology name redirects to the corresponding JSON file located in [this GitHub folder](https://github.com/Azure/video-analyzer/blob/main/pipelines/live/topologies/), clicking on a sample redirects to the corresponding sample document.
