# Configure F5 BIG-IP Access Policy Manager for form-based SSO

In this article, you'll learn how to configure F5's BIG-IP Access Policy Manager (APM) and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for secure hybrid access to form-based applications.

Configuring BIG-IP published applications with Azure AD provides many benefits, including:

- Improved Zero Trust governance through Azure AD pre-authentication and authorization
- Full single sign-on (SSO) between Azure AD and BIG-IP published services
- Identities and access are managed from a single control plane, the Azure portal

To learn about all the benefits, see [Integrate F5 BIG-IP with Azure Active Directory](f5-aad-integration.md) and [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure AD?](../active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## Scenario description

For this scenario, we have an internal legacy application that's configured for form-based authentication (FBA).

The ideal scenario is to have the application managed and governed directly through Azure AD. But, because the app lacks modern protocol interoperability, it would take considerable effort and time to modernize, which introduces the inevitable costs and risks of potential downtime.

Instead, a BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE), deployed between the internet and the internal Azure virtual network that the app is connected to, is used to gate inbound access to Azure AD because of its extensive authentication and authorization capabilities.

Having BIG-IP in front of the application lets you overlay the service with Azure AD pre-authentication and form-based SSO. This approach significantly improves the overall security posture of the application, allowing the business to continue operating at pace, without interruption.

## Scenario Architecture

The secure hybrid access solution for this scenario is made up of the following elements:

**Application**: A back-end service to be protected by Azure AD and BIG-IP secure hybrid access. This particular application validates user credentials against Active Directory, but it could be any directory, including Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services, open source, and so on.

**Azure AD**: The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Identity Provider (IdP), which is responsible for verification of user credentials, Conditional Access (CA), and SSO to the BIG-IP APM.

**BIG-IP**: A reverse proxy and SAML service provider to the application, which delegates authentication to the SAML IdP before it performs form-based SSO to the back-end application. The cached user credentials are then available for SSO against other forms-based authentication applications.

![Screenshot of the flow diagram, from user to application.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/flow-diagram.png)

| Step | Description|
|-------: |:----------|
| 1 | A user connects to the application's SAML service provider endpoint (BIG-IP APM).|
| 2 | The APM access policy redirects the user to the SAML IdP (Azure AD) for pre-authentication.|
| 3 | Azure AD authenticates the user and applies any enforced Conditional Access policies.|
| 4 | User is redirected back to the SAML service provider with the issued token and claims. |
| 5 | BIG-IP prompts the user for an application password and stores it in the cache. |
| 6 | BIG-IP sends a request to the application and receives a logon form.|
| 7 | The APM scripting auto responds, filling in the username and password before it submits the form.|
| 8 | The application payload is served by the web server and sent to the client. |
| | |

## Prerequisites

Prior BIG-IP experience is not necessary, but you'll need:

- An Azure AD subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free subscription.

- An existing BIG-IP, or [deploy BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) in Azure](f5-bigip-deployment-guide.md).

- Any of the following F5 BIG-IP license SKUs:

  - F5 BIG-IP Best bundle
  - F5 BIG-IP Access Policy Manager (APM) standalone license
  - F5 BIG-IP Access Policy Manager (APM) add-on license on existing BIG-IP F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM)
  - 90-day BIG-IP full feature [trial license](https://www.f5.com/trial/big-ip-trial.php)

- User identities [synchronized](../hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis.md) from an on-premises directory to Azure AD.

- An account with Azure AD Application Administrator [permissions](../roles/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator).

- [An SSL certificate](f5-bigip-deployment-guide.md#ssl-profile) for publishing services over HTTPS, or use default certificates during testing.

- An existing form-based authentication application, or [set up an IIS FBA app](/troubleshoot/aspnet/forms-based-authentication) for testing.

## Deployment modes

Several methods exist for configuring a BIG-IP for this scenario. This article covers the advanced approach, a more flexible way to implement secure hybrid access in which you manually create all BIG-IP configuration objects. You can use this approach for scenarios that aren't covered by the template-based guided configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> You should replace all example strings or values in this article with those for your actual environment.

## Add F5 BIG-IP from the Azure AD gallery

Setting up a SAML federation trust between BIG-IP APM and Azure AD is one of the first steps in implementing secure hybrid access. It establishes the integration that's required for BIG-IP to hand off pre-authentication and [CA](../conditional-access/overview.md) to Azure AD, before it grants access to the published service.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal by using an account with Application Administrator permissions.

1. On the left pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.

1. Go to **Enterprise Applications** and then, in the ribbon, select **New application**.

1. Search for **F5** in the gallery, and then select **F5 BIG-IP APM Azure AD integration**.

1. Provide a name for the application, and then select **Add/Create** to add it to your tenant. The name should reflect that specific service.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

1. With the new **F5** application properties in view, select **Manage** > **Single sign-on**.

1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**. Skip the prompt to save the single sign-on settings by selecting **No, I'll save later**.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** pane, select the **Edit** button (pen icon) for **Basic SAML Configuration**, and then do the following:

   a. Replace the pre-defined **Identifier** URL with the URL for your BIG-IP published service (for example, `https://myvacation.contoso.com`).

   b. Replace the pre-defined **Reply URL** with the URL for your BIG-IP published service, but include the path for the APM SAML endpoint (for example, `https://myvacation.contoso.com/saml/sp/profile/post/acs`).

      >[!NOTE]
      >In this configuration, the SAML flow would operate in IdP-initiated mode, where Azure AD issues users a SAML assertion before they're redirected to the BIG-IP service endpoint for the application. The BIG-IP APM supports both IdP-initiated and service provider-initiated modes.

   c. For the `Logout URI`, enter the BIG-IP APM single logout (SLO) endpoint, prepended by the host header of the service that's being published. Providing an SLO URI ensures that users' BIG-IP APM session is also terminated after they're signed out of Azure AD. An example URI might be `https://myvacation.contoso.com/saml/sp/profile/redirect/slr`.

     ![Screenshot showing a basic SAML configuration.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/basic-saml-configuration.png)

     >[!Note]
     > As of F5 Traffic Management Operating System (TMOS) v16, the SAML SLO endpoint is /saml/sp/profile/redirect/slo.

1. Select **Save** before you close the SAML configuration pane, and skip the SSO test prompt.

   Observe the properties of the **User Attributes & Claims** section. Azure AD will issue them to users for BIG-IP APM authentication and SSO to the back-end application.

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select the **Download** link to save the *Federation Metadata XML* file to your computer.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Federation Metadata XML' download link.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/saml-certificate.png)

   SAML signing certificates that are created by Azure AD have a lifespan of three years. To manage them, use the published guidance in [Manage certificates for federated single sign-on](manage-certificates-for-federated-single-sign-on.md).

### Azure AD authorization

By default, Azure AD issues tokens only to users that have been granted access to an application.

1. In the application's configuration view, select **Users and groups**.

1. Select **Add user** and then, on the **Add Assignment** pane, select **Users and groups**.

1. On the **Users and groups** pane, add the groups of users that are authorized to access the internal application, and then select **Select** > **Assign**.

This completes the Azure AD part of the SAML federation trust. You can now set up the BIG-IP APM to publish the internal web application and then configure it with a corresponding set of properties that complete the trust for SAML pre-authentication and SSO.

## Advanced configuration

### The SAML service provider

These settings define the SAML service provider properties that the APM will use for overlaying the legacy application with SAML pre-authentication.

1. Select **Access** > **Federation** > **SAML Service Provider** > **Local SP Services**, and then select **Create**.

   ![Screenshot showing the F5 forms configuration.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/f5-forms-configuration.png)

1. On the **Create New SAML SP Service** pane, provide a name and the same entity ID that you defined earlier in Azure AD.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Create New SAML SP Service' pane, showing the name and entity ID of the new SAML service provider service.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/saml-sp-service.png)

    The values in the **SP Name Settings** section are required only if the entity ID isn't an exact match of the hostname portion of the published URL or, equally, if the entity ID isn't in regular hostname-based URL format. Provide the external scheme and hostname of the application that's being published if the entity ID is *urn:myvacation:contosoonline*.

### The external IdP connector

A SAML IdP connector defines the settings that are required for the BIG-IP APM to trust Azure AD as its SAML IdP. These settings map the SAML service provider to a SAML IdP, which establishes the federation trust between the APM and Azure AD.

1. Select the new SAML service provider object, and then select **Bind/UnbBind IdP Connectors**.

   ![Screenshot showing local service provider services and the 'Bind/Unbind IdP Connectors' button.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/local-services.png)

1. In the **Create New IdP Connector** dropdown list, select **From Metadata**.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'From Metadata' option in the 'Create New IdP Connector' dropdown list.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/from-metadata.png)
  
1. On the **Create New SAML IdP Connector** pane, browse for the Federation Metadata XML file that you downloaded earlier, and then provide an **Identity Provider Name** for the APM object that will represent the external SAML IdP (for example, *MyVacation\_AzureAD*).

   ![Screenshot of the 'Create New SAML IdP Connector' pane for creating a new IdP SAML connector.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/new-idp-saml-connector.png)

1. Select **Add New Row** to choose the new **SAML IdP Connector**, and then select **Update**.
  
   ![Screenshot showing how to add a new row.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/add-new-row.png)

1. Select **OK** to save your settings.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Edit SAML IdPs that use this SP' pane.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/edit-saml-idp-using-sp.png)

### Form-based SSO

You can perform FBA SSO in either client-initiated mode or by the BIG-IP itself. Both methods emulate a user logon by injecting credentials into the username and password tags before auto submitting the form. The flow is almost transparent, except that users have to provide their password once when they access an FBA application. The password is then cached for reuse across other FBA applications.

This covers the APM approach, which manages SSO directly for the back-end application.

Select **Access** > **Single Sign-on** > **Forms Based**, select **Create**, and then provide the following values:

|Property | Description |
|:------|:---------|
| Name | Use a descriptive name for the configuration, because an SSO APM object can be reused by other published applications. For example, use *Contoso\FBA\sso*.|
| Use SSO Template | None |
| Username Source | The preferred username source for pre-filling the password collection form. You can use any APM session variable, but the default *session.sso.token.last.username* tends to work best, because it contains the logged-in users' Azure AD UPN. |
| Password Source | Keep the default *session.sso.token.last.password*, it's the APM variable that the BIG-IP will use to cache the password that's provided by users. |
| | |

![Screenshot showing a new SSO configuration.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/new-sso-configuration.png)

|Property | Description |
|:------|:---------|
| Start URI | The logon URI of your FBA application. The APM form-based authentication executes SSO when the request URI matches this URI value.|
| Form Actions | Leave this value blank so that the original request URL is used for SSO. |
| Form Parameter for Username | The element name of your logon form's username field. Use your browser's dev tools to determine this.| 
| Form Parameter for Password | The element name of your logon form's password field. Use your browser's dev tools to determine this.|
| | |

![Screenshot of the SSO Method Configuration pane.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/sso-method-configuration.png)

For more information about configuring an APM for FBA SSO, go to the F5 [Single Sign-On Methods](https://techdocs.f5.com/en-us/bigip-14-1-0/big-ip-access-policy-manager-single-sign-on-concepts-configuration-14-1-0/single-sign-on-methods.html#GUID-F8588DF4-F395-4E44-881B-8D16EED91449) site.

### Access profile configuration

An access profile binds many APM elements managing access to BIG-IP virtual servers, including access policies, SSO configuration, and UI settings.

1. Select **Access** > **Profiles / Policies** > **Access Profiles (Per-Session Policies)** > **Create**, and then provide the following values:

   | Property | Description |
   |:-----|:-------|
   | Name | For example, *MyVacation* |
   |Profile Type | All |
   | SSO Configuration | The FBA SSO configuration object you just created|
   |Accepted Language | Add at least one language|
   | | |

   ![Screenshot showing how to create a new access profile.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/create-new-access-profile.png)

1. Modify the session policy to present a logon page with the username pre-filled. To launch the APM Visual Policy Editor, select the **Edit** link next to the per-session profile you just created.

   ![Screenshot showing edit per-session policy](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/edit-per-session-policy.png)

1. In the APM Visual Policy Editor, select the **+** sign next to the
   fallback.

   ![Screenshot of the APM Visual Policy Editor showing the plus sign (+) next to the fallback.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/vpe-launched.png)

1. In the pop-up window, select **Authentication**, select **SAML Auth**, and then select **Add Item**.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'SAML Auth' control selected and the 'Add Items' button.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/saml-auth-add-item.png)

1. On the **SAML authentication SP** configuration pane, change the name to **Azure AD Auth** and then, in the **AAA Server** dropdown list, enter the SAML service provider object that you created earlier.

   ![Screenshot showing the Azure AD Authentication server settings.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/azure-ad-auth-server.png)

1. Select the **+** sign on the **Successful** branch.

1. In the pop-up window, select **Authentication**, select **Logon Page**, and then select **Add Item**.

   ![Screenshot shows logon page settings](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/logon-page.png)

1. In the **Read Only** column for the **username** field, in the dropdown list, select **Yes**.

   ![Screenshot showing the username 'Read Only' option changed to 'Yes'.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/set-read-only-as-yes.png)

1. Add an SSO Credential Mapping object by selecting the plus sign (**+**) for the logon page fallback.

1. In the pop-up window, select the **Assignment** tab, select **SSO Credential Mapping**, and then select **Add Item**.

    ![Screenshot showing the 'SSO Credential Mapping' option and its description.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/sso-credential-mapping.png)

1. On the **Variable Assign: SSO Credential Mapping** pane, keep the default settings, and then select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot showing the 'Save' button on the 'Variable Assign: SSO Credential Mapping' pane.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/save-sso-credential-mapping.png)

1. Select the link in the upper **Deny** box to change the **Successful** branch to **Allow**, and then select **Save**.

**Attribute mapping**

(Optional) By adding a LogonID_Mapping configuration, you can enable the BIG-IP active sessions list to display the UPN of the logged-in user instead of a session number. This action is useful when you're analyzing logs or troubleshooting.

1. Select the plus sign (**+**) next to the SAML Auth **Successful** branch.

1. In the pop-up window, select the **Assignment** tab, select **Variable Assign**, and then select **Add Item**.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'Variable Assign' option and its description.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/variable-assign.png)

1. On the **Properties** pane, enter a descriptive name (for example,
*LogonID_Mapping*) and, under **Variable Assign**, select **Add new entry** > **change**.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'Add new entry' field.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/add-new-entry.png)

1. Set both variables to use the following properties:

   | Property | Description |
   |:-----|:-------|
   | Custom Variable | `session.logon.last.username` |
   | Session Variable | `session.saml.last.identity`|
   | | |

1. Select **Finished**, and then select **Save**.

1. Commit those settings by selecting **Apply Access Policy** at the upper left, and then close the Visual Policy Editor.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'Apply Access Policy' pane.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/apply-access-policy.png)

### Back-end pool configuration

For the BIG-IP to know where to forward client traffic, you need to create a BIG-IP node object that represents the back-end server that hosts your application. Then, place that node in a BIG-IP server pool.

1. Select **Local Traffic** > **Pools** > **Pool List**, select **Create**, and then provide a name for a server pool object (for example, *MyApps_VMs*).

   ![Screenshot shows pool list](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/pool-list.png)

1. Add a pool member object with the following properties:

   | Property | Description |
   |:-----|:-------|
   | Node Name | (Optional) The display name for the server that hosts the back-end web application |
   | Address | The IP address of the server that hosts the application |
   | Service Port | The HTTP or HTTPS port that the application is listening on |
   | | |

   ![Screenshot showing the pool member properties.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/pool-member.png)

>[!NOTE]
>Health monitors require additional configuration that's not covered in this article. For more information, see the F5 article [K13397: Overview of HTTP health monitor request formatting for the BIG-IP DNS system](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13397).

## Virtual server configuration

A virtual server is a BIG-IP data-plane object that's represented by a virtual IP address that listens for client requests to the application. Any received traffic is processed and evaluated against the APM access profile that's associated with the virtual server. The traffic is then directed according to the policy results and settings.

1. Select **Local Traffic** > **Virtual Servers** > **Virtual Server List**, select **Create**, and then do the following:

   a. For **Name**, enter the virtual server name (for example, *MyVacation*).

   ![Screenshot showing the virtual server properties.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/virtual-server.png)  

   b. For **Destination Address/Mask**, enter an unused IP IPv4/IPv6 that can be assigned to the BIG-IP to receive client traffic.  
   c. For **Service Port**, enter **443** and **HTTPS**.  
   
1. **SSL Profile (Client)**: Enables Transport Layer Security (TLS), enabling services to be published over HTTPS. Select the client SSL profile that you created as part of the prerequisites, or keep the default settings if you're testing.

   ![Screenshot showing an SSL profile.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/ssl-profile.png)

1. Change the **Source Address Translation** to **Auto Map**.

   ![Screenshot showing that 'Auto Map' is selected.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/auto-map.png)

1. Under **Access Policy**, in the **Access Profile** box, enter the name you created earlier. This action binds the Azure AD SAML pre-authentication profile and FBA SSO policy to the virtual server.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'Access Policy' pane.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/access-policy.png)

1. Finally, for **Default Pool**, select the back-end pool object that you created earlier.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'Default Pool' setting on the 'Resources' pane.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/default-pool.png)

## Session management

You use BIG-IP session management settings to define the conditions under which user sessions are terminated or allowed to continue, limits for users and IP addresses, and error pages. You can create your own policy by selecting **Access Policy** > **Access Profiles** and then selecting your application from the list.

As for SLO functionality, when you define a single logout URI in Azure AD, you help ensure that an IdP-initiated sign-out from the MyApps portal also terminates the session between the client and the BIG-IP APM.

When you've imported the application's federation metadata.xml, you give the APM the Azure AD SAML SLO endpoint for service provider-initiated sign-outs. But for this to be truly effective, the APM needs to know exactly when users sign out.

In scenarios where a BIG-IP web portal isn't used, users have no way to instruct the APM to sign out. Even if users sign out of the application itself, the BIG-IP is technically unaware of this action, so the application session could easily be reinstated through SSO. For this reason, the service provider-initiated sign-out needs careful consideration to ensure that sessions are securely terminated when they're no longer required.

One way to achieve this would be to add an SLO function to your app's sign-out button, so that it can redirect your client to the Azure AD SAML sign-out endpoint. You can find the SAML sign-out endpoint for your tenant by selecting **App Registrations** > **Endpoints**.

If making a change to the app is a no-go, consider having the BIG-IP listen for the app's sign-out call. When it detects the request, have it trigger SLO. For more information about using BIG-IP iRules to achieve this, see the following F5 articles: 
* [K42052145: Configuring automatic session termination (logout) based on a URI-referenced file name](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K42052145)
* [K12056: Overview of the Logout URI Include option](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K12056)

## Troubleshoot access to the application

Failure to access the secure hybrid access-protected application can result from any of several factors, including a misconfiguration. When you troubleshoot this issue, be aware of the following:

- FBA SSO is performed by the BIG-IP as it parses the logon form at the specified URI and looks for the username and password element tags that are defined in your configuration.

- Element tags need to be consistent, or SSO will fail. More complex forms that are generated dynamically might require you to analyze them closer by using dev tools to understand the makeup of the logon form.

- A client-initiated approach might be better suited for logon pages that contain multiple forms, because it lets you specify a form name and even customize the JavaScript form handler logic.

- Both FBA SSO methods optimize the user experience and security by hiding all form interactions. In some cases, though, it might be useful to validate whether the credentials are actually being injected. You can do this in client-initiated mode by disabling the form auto submit setting in your SSO profile and then using dev tools to disable the two style properties that prevent the logon page from being displayed.

  ![Screenshot showing the properties page.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/properties.png)

BIG-IP logs are a great source of information for isolating all sorts of authentication and SSO issues. When you troubleshoot an issue, you should increase the log verbosity level by doing the following:

1. Go to **Access Policy** > **Overview** > **Event Logs** > **Settings**.

1. Select the row for your published application, and then select **Edit** > **Access System Logs**.

1. In the SSO list, select **Debug**, and then select **OK**. Reproduce your issue before you look at the logs, but remember to switch this setting back when you're finished.

If you see a BIG-IP branded error immediately after successful Azure AD pre-authentication, it's possible that the issue relates to SSO from Azure AD to the BIG-IP.

Go to **Access** > **Overview** > **Access reports**, and then run the report for the last hour to see whether the logs provide any clues. The **View session variables** link for your session will also help you understand whether the APM is receiving the expected claims from Azure AD.

If you don't see a BIG-IP error page, the issue is probably more related to the back-end request or SSO from the BIG-IP to the
application. If this is the case, select **Access Policy** > **Overview** > **Active Sessions**, and then select the link for your active session.

The **View Variables** link in this location might also help determine the root cause, particularly if the APM fails to obtain the right user identifier and password.

For more information, see the F5 BIG-IP [Session Variables reference](https://techdocs.f5.com/en-us/bigip-15-0-0/big-ip-access-policy-manager-visual-policy-editor/session-variables.html).

## Summary

Your application should now be published and accessible via secure hybrid access, either directly via the app's URL or through the Microsoft application portals.

The application should also be visible as a target resource in Azure AD CA. For more information, see [Building a Conditional Access policy](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policies.md).

For increased security, organizations that use this pattern could also consider blocking all direct access to the application, which then forces a strict path through the BIG-IP.

## Next steps

From a browser, connect to the application's external URL or select the application's icon in the MyApps portal. After you authenticate to Azure AD, you’re redirected to the BIG-IP endpoint for the application and prompted for a password. Notice that the APM pre-fills the username with the UPN from Azure AD. The username that's pre-populated by the APM is read only to ensure session consistency between Azure AD and the back-end application. You can hide this field from view with an additional configuration, if necessary.

After the information is submitted, users should be automatically signed in to the application.
